## Description
An Interactive Full-Stack Recipe application using Node, Express, Handlebars, MySQL and Sequelize ORM to connect to the database. This project focuses on the key features and skills required to successfully implement a full stack application. This app also connects to an external API called Spoonacular to generate random recipes as requested by the user. The API connection is made using Axios which is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. Text animation was added to the homepage using Anime.js which is a lightweight JavaScript animation library. Finally this app was deployed with Heroku.
